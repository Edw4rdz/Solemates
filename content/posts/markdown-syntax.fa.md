### **Jordan Luka 3 PF 'Imaginarium'**
  Price: ₱6,800
</div>
#### **Overview**  
Shift your game into high gear with the lightest Luka yet. Designed to help you create space through acceleration, the Luka 3 features full-length Cushlon 3.0 foam for a smooth heel-to-toe transition. A strong but flexible plate underfoot brings lateral containment, helping you drive out of your step-back to attack the basket.

#### **Personal Review**  
**Rating:** 3.8/5  
The Luka 3 shines with its lightweight design and smooth transitions. However, it lacks the durability needed for intense games.

#### **How to Improve**  
- Reinforce durability in high-wear areas.  
- Add better arch support for extended play.
